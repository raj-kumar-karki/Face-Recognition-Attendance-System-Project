# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System-Project
Face Recognition Based Attendance System Project - 6th sem Project-II

Abstract
We are living in a world where everything is automated and linked online. The internet of things, image processing, and machine learning are evolving day by day. Many systems have been completely changed due to this evolve to achieve more accurate results. The attendance system is a typical example of this transition, starting from the traditional signature on a paper sheet to face recognition.This Project proposes a method of developing a comprehensive embedded class attendance system using facial recognition with showing whether the face of the person is the students for the specified class or not. The system is based on the machine learning algorithm which is to be implemented on python language and using computer/laptop camera for the input image of the students or a normal outer camera can also be used which has to be connected to the system which is programmed to handle the face recognition by implementing the Local Binary Patterns algorithm LBPHs.

Problem Statement
Traditional student attendance marking technique is often facing a lot of trouble. The face recognition student attendance system emphasizes its simplicity by eliminating classical student attendance marking technique such as calling student names or checking respective identification cards. There are not only disturbing the teaching process but also causes distraction for students during exam sessions. Apart from calling names, attendance sheet is passed around the classroom during the lecture sessions. The lecture class especially the class with a large number of students might find it difficult to have the attendance sheet being passed around the class. 

Solution 
Thus, face recognition student attendance system is proposed in order to replace the manual signing of the presence of students which are burdensome and causes students get distracted in order to sign for their attendance. Furthermore, the face recognition based automated student attendance system able to overcome the problem of fraudulent approach and lecturers does not have to count the number of students several times to ensure the presence of the students.
